Manuals
=======

The manuals section is intended for end users and included documents 
that guide users through the various features and apps included in the 
pydidas suite.

Manuals are organized according to workflows and manuals exist for both
command line and GUI interfaces. While the underlying operations are 
the same for both interfaces, the setup typically is very different.
