Introduction
************

Two main use cases have been considered:

1. Fast (quasi-live) analysis of diffraction data during beamtimes.
2. Supply users with an easy-to-use software solution which can also 
   be used by users offline and offsite with no/minimal supervision from 
   beamline staff.
   
The rational behind these two use cases are

- Fast analysis of diffraction data can improve beamtime efficiency,
  for example in optimizing *in situ* / *operando* conditions
- Give beamline staff software tools which facilitate user support
  during experiments.
- Give users a software tool which allows them to work with their data
  more independantly of beamline staff support.
- Support users with managing and automatically analyzing ever growing
  datasets.
