Explanations of Scan multi-frame handling
-----------------------------------------


The multi-frame handling allows to specify how individual (detector) frames are 
assigned to *scan points*, i.e. to the scanned grid of time and/or motor positions.

The parameter *Frame index stepping per scan point* defines how the global frame
counter is incremented for each scan point. For example, if the value is set to 1,
the frame counter will be incremented by 1 for each scan point. This corresponds to a 
1:1 relation between scan points and data frames. At a value of 3, the frame counter 
would be incremented by 3 for each scan point, i.e. scan point #0 would use frame #0, 
scan point #1 would use frame #3, etc. 

The *Frames to process per scan point* determines how many frames are processed
at each scan point. If this value larger than 1, the *Frame index stepping per 
scan point* will determine the first frame index that is used for the scan point.

The *Multi-frame handling* parameter defines how the individual frames should be
processed for each scan point. The given operation will be applied per pixel. Note 
that this parameter is only relevant if the *Frames to process per scan point*
is larger than 1. The options are:

    - **Average**: The average of the frames is calculated and assigned to the 
      scan point.
    -  **Sum**: The sum of the frames is calculated and assigned to the scan point.
    - **Maximum**: The maximum of the frames is calculated and assigned to the scan
      point.
    - **Stack**: The individual frames are loaded and an image stack is created and
      assigned to the scan point. This will result in a multi-dimensional dataset.

**Note:** The multi-frame handling applies to the individual frame, not files.
Files with multiple frames per file, e.g. HDF5 files, are compatible because the 
frames in each file are treated individually.

**Note: If multiple frames are processed at each scan point, the number of scan
points must be reduced accordingly.** For example, if 30 frames have been acquired
and 3 frames are processed at each scan point, the number of scan points cannot be
larger than 10. If n_frames is the total number of frames, delta is the increment of
the frame index per scan point, and m_frames is the number of frames processed at
each scan point, the maximum number of scan points is given by:
``max_scan_points = (n_frames - m_frames + 1) / delta``, rounded down to the nearest
integer. Please consult the table below for examples of how
the number of scan points must be adjusted depending on the parameters:


+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
| Total number   | Frame index stepping   | Frames to process   | Maximum number       |
| of frames      | per scan point         | per scan point      | of scan points       |
+================+========================+=====================+======================+
| 30             | 1                      | 1                   | 30                   |
+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
| 30             | 3                      | 1                   | 10                   |
+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
|                | If only every third frame is used, the maximum number of            |
|                | scan points must be divided by 3.                                   |
+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
| 30             | 1                      | 3                   | 28                   |
+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
|                | If 3 frames are processed at each scan point, the maximum number of |
|                | scan points must be reduced by 2. The scan point #28 will use the   |  
|                | frames #28, #29, and #30 and scan point #29 would require up to     |
|                | frame #31.                                                          |                             
+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
| 30             | 4                      | 6                   | 6                    |
+----------------+------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
|                | Because 6 frames are processed at each scan point, the maximum      |
|                | number of scan points must be reduced by 5. Since the frame index   |
|                | is incremented by 4 for each scan point, the maximum number of scan |
|                | points must be divided by 4. Therefore, a total of (30 - 6 + 1)     |
|                | / 4 = 6 scan points can be used. The last scan point #5 (*) will    |
|                | use the frames #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, and #25. The scan point #6  |
|                | would require up to frame #30 which is not available (**).          |
|                |                                                                     |
|                | (*) Note that counting starts at 0, i.e. #5 is the 6th scan point.  |
|                |                                                                     |
|                | (**) The 30 frames include the frames #0 to #29.                    |

Programmatic access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For accessing the ScanContext parameters programmatically, the following keys
must be used:

An example of modifying the scan/file naming pattern programmatically is shown below:

.. code-block::

    Scan = pydidas.contexts.ScanContext()
    Scan.set_param("frame_indices_per_scan_point", "5")
    Scan.set_param("scan_frames_per_point", 2)
    Scan.set_param("scan_multi_frame_handling", "Sum")
