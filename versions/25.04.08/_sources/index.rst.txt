pydidas
=======


pydidas (**py**\ thon **DI**\ ffraction **D**\ ata **A**\ nalysis **S**\ uite)
is a toolset developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon to improve the ease of use
and efficiency of diffraction data analysis. A key requirement is to create
a graphical user interface of the software and processing which scales with
available resources to allow running pydidas on a wide range of machines from
a small laptop up to a central cluster at the facility level.
